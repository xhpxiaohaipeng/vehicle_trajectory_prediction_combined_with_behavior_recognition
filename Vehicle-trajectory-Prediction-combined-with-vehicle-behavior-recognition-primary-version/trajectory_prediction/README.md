#A trajectory Prediction LSTM Model combined with vehicle behavior recognition.
This code predicts the trajectory of the vehicle in the next 3 seconds.
1. Run the LSTM_behavior_prediction-8.ipynb file to train a behavior recognition model.
2. Running LSTM_Trajectory_prediction-8-behavior.ipynb and LSTM_Trajectory_prediction-8-nobehavior.ipynb, respectively makes a comparison of whether the vehicle behavior is considered or not.
3. The dataset is in the pickle file(firstly yopu should extract it).
If you want to know more, please refer to my paper "UB-LSTM:A trajectory prediction method combined with vehicle behavior recognition".
