#A trajectory Prediction LSTM Model combined with vehicle behavior recognition.
This code predicts the trajectory of the vehicle in the next 3 seconds.

The codes inclue 2 version.
1.The primary version code is for vehivle simulation trajectory prediction based on NGSIM dataset. 
2.The final version code is for real vehicle trajectory prediction based on real car dataset that is collected by our own intelligent car,and which includes the migration of vehicle trajectory prediction models trained by real vehicle dataset.
If you want to know more, please refer to my paper "UB-LSTM:A trajectory prediction method combined with vehicle behavior recognition" for vehicle trajectory prediction and "An Improved LSTM Model for Behavior Recognition of Intelligent Vehicles" for vehicle behavior recognition.
