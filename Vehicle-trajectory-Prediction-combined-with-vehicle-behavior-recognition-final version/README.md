#A trajectory Prediction LSTM Model combined with vehicle behavior recognition.
This is the fianl version based on real car dataset that is collected by our own intelligent car.
This code predicts the trajectory of the vehicle in the next 3 seconds.
1. Run the behavior_prediction.ipynb file to train a behavior recognition model.
2. Running trajectory_prediction.ipynb and trajectory_prediction-nobehavior.ipynb, respectively makes a comparison of whether the vehicle behavior is considered or not.
3. The dataset is in the pickle file(only use a small amount of data as a demonstration).
If you want to know more, please refer to my paper "UB-LSTM:A trajectory prediction method combined with vehicle behavior recognition".
